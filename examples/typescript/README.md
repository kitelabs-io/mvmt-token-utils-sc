## Examples

These examples show how to build common tasks in Typescript.

### Running an example

To run a example, first install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

At this point, you can run any of the examples. For example, to run the `get_token_balances` example:

```bash
npm run get_token_balances
```

This will then print out the results of the test accordingly.
